# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## This project was to get ready for bootcamp to improve my professional life. I built this in order to learn the basics of coding by actually doing it. This solves my literal lack of no knowledge of coding before this. I learned how to build a basic website. Something probably from like early internet days when celebrity fan sites were common and weird.

## Usage

This can be used to see my struggles in learning it and how I overcame them. Also, each section has notes on Java Script, git and the like. This can also be used to take additional notes and trial and error to see how you can improve your coding skille and work in a command console or mess with margins and what not.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
